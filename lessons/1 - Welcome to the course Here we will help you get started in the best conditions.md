# How to use the ML AZ folder Google Colab

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Get your Google Colab Notebooks :  
`https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OFNnrHRZPZ3unWdErjLHod8Ibv2FfG1d usp=sharing`   
and Course Datasets :  
`https://sds-platform-private.s3-us-east-2.amazonaws.com/uploads/Machine-Learning-A-Z-Codes-Datasets.zip`.  
You can also browse the course slides :

The codes are implemented on `Google Colab` notebooks, so please make sure to have a Gmail address because you will need a Google Drive to work on the Colab notebooks.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to introduce you `Google Colab` because it's for me the best interface to start with when coding machine learning models. And the reason for this is that not only it's super user friendly that you will see, but also the beauty is that everything are the preinstalled so we don't have anythings to worry about when it comes to installing packages.
